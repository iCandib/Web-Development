    <p>
      MOLLIE SPIESMAN LCSW PLLC, and its affiliated entities (collectively, the
      “Companies,” “we” or “us“) respect and are committed to protecting your
      privacy. Generally, you can browse through our Website without giving us
      any information about yourself. When we do need to collect your PII
      (defined below) to provide you with the Service, or when you choose to
      provide us with your PII, this Privacy Policy describes how we collect,
      use and disclose your PII, except for personal health information
      submitted by you in the course of using our Service. Any conflict between
      this Privacy Policy and the HIPAA Policy with respect to such submitted
      personal health information shall be resolved in favor of the HIPAA
      Policy. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy
      Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same
      meanings as in our Terms of Service. Therefore, please make sure that you
      have read and understand our Terms of Service.
    </p>
    <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
    <p>
      Any information that is collected via our Website, App or the Service is
      covered by the Privacy Policy or the HIPAA Policy in effect at the time
      such information is collected. We may amend this Privacy Policy from time
      to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your PII, we
      will notify you of those changes by posting on the Service and Website or
      by sending you an email or other notification, and we will update the
      “Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.
    </p>
    <h4>Information Collection</h4>
    <p>
      Personally identifiable Information (<strong>"PII"</strong>) means any information that may
      be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first
      and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address,
      and phone number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Account Information. We collect your PII when you register with the
      Companies for a MOLLIE SPIESMAN LCSW PLLC consultation, supervision,
      resource sign up, or when you submit your PII to us through the Service
      for any other reason. If you create an account through the Website, we may
      also collect your title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry,
      personal interests, and other information that is not considered PII
      because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies and Tracking Technology. A <strong>"cookie"</strong> is a small data file that
      certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie
      file can contain information such as a user ID that the website uses to
      track the pages you've visited, but the only PII a cookie can contain is
      information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard
      disk or read cookie files created by other websites. Some parts of the
      Service use cookies to understand user traffic patterns and to tell us how
      and when you interact with our Website and Service. We do this in order to
      determine the usefulness of our Website and Service information to our
      users, to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users
      reach that information and to customize and improve our Website and
      Service. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you
      log off from the Website, App and Service and close your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our Website and
      Service, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and
      refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can
      also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not
      need to have cookies turned on to use/navigate through many parts of our
      Website and Service, although if you do so, you may not be able to access
      all portions or features of the Website and Service. Some third-party
      services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may
      also place their own cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy
      Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies
      by such third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>"Web Beacons"</strong> (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny
      graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Website, App
      and Service for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with
      cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Website and Service,
      to monitor how many visitors view our Website and Service, and to monitor
      the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike cookies, which are stored on
      the user's hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web
      pages (or in an email).
    </p>
    <p>
      Information Related to Your Use of the Service. If you have not created an
      account, when you use our Service, you use our Service and Website
      anonymously. We do automatically log your IP address (the Internet address
      of your computer) and other information such as your browser type,
      operating system, the web page that you were visiting before accessing our
      Website and Service, the pages or features of our Website and Service to
      which you browsed to give us an idea of which part of our Website and
      Service you visit and how long you spend there (we refer to this
      information as <strong>"Log Data"</strong>). But we do not link your IP address to any PII
      unless you have logged in via your account. We use Log Data to administer
      the Website and Service and we analyze (and may engage third parties to
      analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance the Website and
      Service by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them
      to our users' needs and preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information Sent by Your Mobile Device. We collect certain information
      that your mobile device sends when you use our Website and Service, like a
      device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device,
      as well as information about your use of our Website and Service. You
      understand that, by logging in on your mobile device, some information
      pertaining to your medical treatment may be stored on your mobile device.
      We are not responsible for any unauthorized access by any third party to
      such information on your mobile device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Location Information. When you use our website, we may collect and store
      information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough
      geo-location or by accessing your mobile device's GPS coordinates or
      course location if you enable location services on your device. We may use
      location information to improve and personalize our Website for you. If
      you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that
      feature on your mobile device.
    </p>
    <h4>Your Choices</h4>
    <p>
      Opt-Out. We may periodically send you free newsletters and emails that
      directly promote our Service. When you receive such promotional
      communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” (either
      through your account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided
      in the email you receive). We do need to send you certain communications
      regarding the Service and you will not be able to opt out of those
      communications - e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of
      Service or this Privacy Policy or information about billing.
    </p>
    <h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
    <p>
      Your PII is not shared outside of the Companies without your permission,
      except as described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information Shared with Our Services Providers. We may engage third-party
      services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Service.
      These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the
      purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated
      not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information Shared with Third Parties. We may share your aggregated
      information and non-identifying information with third parties to conduct
      on-going quality improvement activities, or for industry research and
      analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.
      Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered
      to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a
      result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if
      our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of
      business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your
      PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in
      connection with the transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. We
      cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties
      to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about
      you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we,
      in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to enforce
      our Terms of Service, (ii) to respond to claims, legal process (including
      subpoenas); (iii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the
      property, rights and safety of a third party, our users, or the public in
      general; (iv) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or
      legally actionable activity; and (v) as required in accordance with HIPAA
      or related applicable local, state or federal laws (please refer to the
      HIPAA Policy).
    </p>
    <h4>Your Ability to Review Your Account and Information</h4>
    <p>
      If you are a registered with MOLLIE SPIESMAN LCSW PLLC and would like to
      revoke your information, email info@molliespiesmanlcsw.com
    </p>
    <h4>Data Security</h4>
    <p>
      Your account information is password-protected for your privacy and
      security. The Companies safeguard the security of the information you
      provide to us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In
      certain areas of our Website, we use industry-standard SSL-encryption to
      enhance the security of data transmissions. While we strive to protect
      your PII, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to
      us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your PII when
      you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of
      letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.
    </p>
    <h4>Responding to Do Not Track Signals</h4>
    <p>
      Our Website does not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track”
      signals received from various web browsers.
    </p>
    <h4>Children and Privacy</h4>
    <p>
      Our Website and Service do not target and are not intended to attract
      children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly solicit PII from
      children under the age of 13 or send them requests for PII. If we learn
      that we have collected PII of a child under 13 directly from that child we
      will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as
      possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may collect PII about children
      under 13 that parents or guardians provide to us when establishing an
      account for their children's records.
    </p>
    <h4>Third Party Sites</h4>
    <p>
      The Website and Service contain links to other sites that are owned or
      operated by third parties. We are not responsible for the content, privacy
      or security practices of any third parties. To protect your information,
      we encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those third
      parties.
    </p>
    <h4>International Transfer</h4>
    <p>
      Your information is stored by the Companies on controlled servers with
      limited access and may be stored and processed in the United States or any
      other country where the Companies or agents are located. If you're located
      outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may
      transfer your PII to the United States and process it there. Those who
      choose to access and use the Service from outside the U.S. do so on their
      own initiative, at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with
      applicable laws.
    </p>
    <h4>Questions or Suggestions</h4>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about our collection, use, or disclosure of your PII, please contact:</p>
