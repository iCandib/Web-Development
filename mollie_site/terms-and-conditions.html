    <h4>17. GOVERNING LAW; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL</h4>
    <p>
      This Agreement, as well as any dispute or claim arising out of or related
      to this Agreement, its subject matter, or its formation (in each case,
      including non-contractual disputes or claims) is governed by and shall be
      construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without
      giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule. The
      United Nations Convention on the International Sales of Goods does not
      apply to this Agreement.
    </p>
    <h4>18. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h4>
    <h4>18.1 Informal Negotiations</h4>
    <p>
      To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy,
      or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a “Dispute” and collectively,
      the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and
      collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to
      negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below)
      informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration.
      Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to
      the other Party.
    </p>
    <h4>18.2 Binding Arbitration</h4>
    <p>
      If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
      negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)
      will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. You
      understand that without this provision, you would have the right to sue in
      court and have a jury trial. The arbitration shall be commenced and
      conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
      Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
      Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer
      Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your
      arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be
      governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the
      AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be
      excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration
      may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone,
      or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not
      provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The
      arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if
      the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the
      applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in
      New York, NY. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may
      litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending
      arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award
      entered by the arbitrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration,
      the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal
      courts located in New York, NY, and the Parties hereby consent to, and
      waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non
      conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and
      federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
      for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information
      Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way
      to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action
      arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then
      neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that
      portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such
      Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the
      courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to
      the personal jurisdiction of that court.
    </p>
    <h4>18.3 Restrictions</h4>
    <p>
      The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
      between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a)
      no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no
      right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action
      basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or
      authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
      capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
    </p>
    <h4>18.4 Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h4>
    <p>
      The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above
      provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a)
      any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of,
      any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute
      related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of
      privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If
      this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
      will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
      provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be
      decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
      jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of that court.

      services online and perform virtual house calls via Internet connection.
      We are not responsible for Internet connectivity or lack thereof or
      problems or issues related to the use of the Internet. Information

      symptoms, based on the information you provide. You acknowledge that your
      relationship for health care services is with your Provider, and such

    <h4>20. INFORMED CONSENT & RISKS</h4>
    <p>
      As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with
      the use of telemedicine or any other Services. While MOLLIE SPIESMAN LCSW
      PLLC believes that the likelihood of these risks materializing is very
      low, you understand that these risks may include, without limitation, the
      following: Delays in medical evaluation and consultation or treatment may
      occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment which may include
      poor video and data quality. Security protocols could fail, causing a
      breach of privacy of personal medical information. Lack of access to
      complete medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or
      allergic reactions or other negative outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You understand that the laws that protect privacy and the confidentiality
      of medical information also apply to telemedicine. You understand that
      telemedicine may involve electronic communication of your personal medical
      information to medical practitioners who may be located in other areas,
      including out of state. You understand that you may expect the anticipated
      benefits from the use of telemedicine, but that no results can be
      guaranteed or assured. You understand that all information will be part of
      your medical record and available to you. This information will have the
      same restrictions on dissemination without your consent. Except to the
      extent already relied upon, you understand you may withdraw your consent
      at any time by contacting us as set forth herein to withdraw your consent
      and inactivate your account. You understand that your healthcare
      information may be shared with other individuals for treatment, payment
      and healthcare operations purposes. Psychotherapy notes are maintained by
      clinicians but are not shared with others, while billing codes and
      encounter summaries are shared with others. If you obtain psychotherapy
      services, you understand that your Provider has the right to limit the
      information provided to you if in your Provider's professional judgment
      sharing the information with you would be harmful to you. You further
      understand that your healthcare information may be shared in the following
      circumstances: When a valid court order is issued for medical records.
      Reporting suspected abuse, neglect, or domestic violence. Preventing or
      reducing a serious threat to anyone's health or safety.
