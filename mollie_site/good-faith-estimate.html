    <p>
      Under the <a href="images/No Surprise Act.pdf"><u>No Surprises Act</u></a> (H.R. 133), health care providers need to give
      clients or patients who do not have insurance or who are not using
      insurance an estimate of the bill for medical items and services.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Good Faith Estimate shows the costs of items and services that are
      reasonably expected for your health care needs for an item or service. The
      estimate is based on information known at the time the estimate was
      created.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected
      cost of any non-emergency items or services. This includes (under the
      law/when applicable) related costs like medical tests, prescription drugs,
      equipment, and hospital fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Good Faith Estimate does not include any unknown or unexpected costs
      that may arise during treatment. You could be charged more if
      complications or special circumstances occur. If this happens, federal law
      allows you to dispute (appeal) the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith
      Estimate, you can dispute the bill.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You may contact the health care provider or facility listed to let them
        know the billed charges are higher than the Good Faith Estimate. You can
        ask them to update the bill to match the Good Faith Estimate, ask to
        negotiate the bill, or ask if there is financial assistance available.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may also start a dispute resolution process with the U.S. Department
        of Health and Human Services (HHS). If you choose to use the dispute
        resolution process, you must start the dispute process within 120
        calendar days (about 4 months) of the date on the original bill.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a $25 fee to use the dispute process. If the agency reviewing
        your dispute agrees with you, you will have to pay the price on this
        Good Faith Estimate. If the agency disagrees with you and agrees with
        the health care provider or facility, you will have to pay the higher
        amount.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Make sure your health care provider gives you a Good Faith Estimate within
      the following timeframes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the service is scheduled at least three business days before the
        appointment date, no later than one business day after the date of
        scheduling;
      </li>
      <li>
        If the service is scheduled at least 10 business days before the
        appointment date, no later than three business days after the date of
        scheduling; or
      </li>
      <li>
        If the uninsured or self-pay patient requests a good faith estimate
        (without scheduling the service), no later than three business days
        after the date of the request. A new good faith estimate must be
        provided, within the specified timeframes if the patient reschedules the
        requested item or service.
      </li>
    </ul>
